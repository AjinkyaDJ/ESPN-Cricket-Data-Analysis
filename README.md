# ESPN-Cricket-Data-Analysis
📊 Project Overview
The ESPN Cricket Data Analysis Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytically robust Power BI report that transforms raw cricket statistics into actionable insights. The dashboard focuses on three core performance dimensions:

🏏 Batting Performance - Runs, strike rates, boundaries, partnerships, and batting averages
⚡ Bowling Performance - Wickets, economy rates, bowling averages, and breakthrough moments
🤾 Fielding Performance - Catches, run-outs, fielding efficiency, and defensive metrics

This tool is intended for use by cricket coaches, team analysts, sports broadcasters, fantasy cricket players, and data science enthusiasts who seek to understand player performance trends and match dynamics through data visualization.

🛠 Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary platform for interactive data visualization and report creation
📂 Power Query – Data transformation and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations for cleaning and reshaping cricket statistics
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Advanced calculations for custom metrics, conditional logic, and dynamic measures
📝 Data Modeling – Established relationships between batting, bowling, and fielding tables to enable cross-filtering and comprehensive analysis
🎨 Custom Visuals – Utilized specialized Power BI visuals for enhanced cricket-specific analytics
📁 File Format – .pbit (Power BI Template) for easy distribution and customization


📂 Data Source
Source: ESPN Cricinfo / Cricket Statistics Database
The dataset includes comprehensive cricket match data covering:

Player Statistics – Individual batting, bowling, and fielding performance metrics
Match Details – Venue, date, match type (Test, ODI, T20), and match outcomes
Team Performance – Team-level aggregations and comparative analysis
Historical Data – Performance trends over multiple seasons and tournaments

Data Coverage:

Multiple cricket formats (Test, ODI, T20, IPL)
International and domestic matches
Player career statistics and match-by-match breakdowns
Time-series data for trend analysis


🌟 Dashboard Features
🎯 Business Problem
Cricket is a data-rich sport with complex performance metrics across batting, bowling, and fielding. Key stakeholders face several challenges:
Key Questions:

Which batsmen have the highest strike rates in pressure situations?
Which bowlers are most economical in the death overs?
How do fielding statistics impact match outcomes?
What are the performance trends of players across different formats?
How do home vs. away performances differ for teams and players?

Without an intuitive analytical tool, answering these questions requires manual data aggregation and analysis, making it difficult to identify patterns quickly and make data-driven decisions.
🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive visual analytics platform that:
✅ Enables comprehensive cricket performance analysis across all three disciplines
✅ Supports strategic decision-making for team selection, player evaluation, and match strategy
✅ Uncovers hidden patterns in player performance, match dynamics, and winning factors
✅ Facilitates comparative analysis between players, teams, and match formats
✅ Provides real-time insights through dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities
